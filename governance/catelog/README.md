### Searching for insightful data in unified view
- Data consumers don't know the location and origin of data. They have to navigate data "swamps".
- Data consumers don't know what data to use to get insights because most data is not well documented and, even if documented, is not well maintained.
- Data can't be found and is often lost when it resides only in people's minds.
### Understanding data
Support data-driven decision making and accelerate the insight time by enriching data with technical and business metadata.
- Is the data fresh, clean, validated, approved for use in production?
- Which dataset out of several duplicate sets is relevant and up-to-date?
- How does one dataset relate to another?
- Who is using the data and who is the owner?
- Who and what processes are transforming the data?
### Making data useful
- Take **ownership** over the data to improve trust and confidence in it.
- **self-service**: Data producers don't have an efficient way to put forward their data for consumers. 
  - If there's no self-service, consumers may overwhelm producers. Several data engineers can't manually provide data to thousands of data analysts.
- Valuable time is lost if data consumers have to find out how to request data access, request it, wait without a defined response time, escalate, and wait again.
