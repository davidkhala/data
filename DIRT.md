## [Data & Innovation Recurring Tax](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/solutions/use-cases/innovation-tax)
Unnecessary data complexity because of adding multiple Databases and ETL Pipelines becomes a tax on companies trying to innovate in the form of a fragmented and inefficient developer experience, a multitude of operational and security models to deal with, lots of data integration work and data duplication.

This recurring tax is one that companies and their developers are paying (year in and year out)
