Project Jupyter: [Free software, open standards, and web services for interactive computing across all programming languages](https://jupyter.org/)


# About
- Born out of Interactive Python (IPython) in 2014
- An indirect acronym of three languages: Julia + Python + R = Jupyter
- The success story: Fernando Pérez, the cofounder of Jupyter once said,
  - > growth of Jupyter is due to the improvements that were made in the web software, which drives applications such as Gmail and Google Docs and the ease with which it facilitates access to remote data which might otherwise be impractical to download.
  - > The maturation of scientific Python and data science is another reason for this platform to gain traction.

# Jupyter notebook
Interactive web-based computational notebook
- more than 2.5 million public Jupyter notebooks were shared in September 2018
- File format `.ipynb`: acronym for **Interactive Python Notebook**
- The de facto choice for data scientists for practising and sharing various codes, quick prototyping, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

It is combined of three components — the notebook application, kernels, and notebook documents.
## web app: The notebook application
The notebook web application is used for writing and running codes in an interactive way
## kernels 
Kernels controls the system by running and introspecting users’ codes.
## Notebook documents
Notebook documents are the self-contained documents of all the contents visible in the notebook. 
- Each document in the notebook has the kernel that controls it.
